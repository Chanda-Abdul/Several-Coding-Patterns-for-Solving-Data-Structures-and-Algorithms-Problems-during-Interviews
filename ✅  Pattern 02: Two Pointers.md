# Pattern 2: Two Pointers

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or <b>LinkedList</b>s) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the <b>two pointers</b> approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray. For example, take a look at the following problem:

> Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

To solve this problem, we can consider each element one by one (pointed out by the first pointer) and iterate through the remaining elements (pointed out by the second pointer) to find a pair with the given sum. The time complexity of this algorithm will be `O(N^2)` where `N` is the number of elements in the input array.

Given that the input array is sorted, an efficient way would be to start with one pointer in the beginning and another pointer at the end. At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> add up to the target sum. If they do not, we will do one of two things:
1. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> is greater than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can decrement the end-pointer.
2. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> is smaller than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can increment the start-pointer.

## üå¥ Pair with Target Sum  aka "Two Sum" (easy) 
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
> Given an array of sorted numbers and a `target` sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given `target`.

Write a function to return the indices of the two numbers (i.e. the pair) such that they add up to the given `target`.

Since the given array is sorted, a brute-force solution could be to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time and searching for the second number through <b>Binary Search</b>. The time complexity of this algorithm will be `O(N*logN)`. Can we do better than this?

We can follow the <b>Two Pointers</b> approach. We will start with one pointer pointing to the beginning of the array and another pointing at the end. At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> add up to the `target` sum. If they do, we have found our pair; otherwise, we will do one of two things:
1. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> is greater than the `target` sum, this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can decrement the end-pointer.
2. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the <b>two pointers</b> is smaller than the `target` sum, this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can increment the start-pointer.
### Brute Force Solution
````js
function pair_with_targetsum(nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for(let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if((nums[i] + nums[j]) === target) {
        //they cannot be at the same index
        if(i !== j) {
          return [i, j]
        }
      } 
    }
  }
}
````
### Two pointer Solution
* Assume the input is sorted
````js
function pairWithTargetSum(arr, target) {
  let start = 0
  let end = arr.length-1
  
  while(start < end) {
    let currentSum = arr[start] + arr[end]
    
    if(currentSum === target) {
      return [start, end]
    }
    
    if(currentSum < target) {
      start++
    } else {
      end--
    }
  }
  return 0  
}

pairWithTargetSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6)//[1,3]
pairWithTargetSum([2, 5, 9, 11], 11)//[0,2]
````
- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in the given array.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.

### ‚ùó Hash Table Solution 

Instead of using a two-pointer or a binary search approach, we can utilize a <b>HashTable</b> to search for the required pair. We can iterate through the array one number at a time. Let‚Äôs say during our iteration we are at number `X`, so we need to find `Y` such that `‚ÄúX + Y == Target‚Äù`. We will do two things here:
1. Search for `Y` (which is equivalent to `‚ÄúTarget - X‚Äù`) in the HashTable. If it is there, we have found the required pair.
2. Otherwise, insert `‚ÄúX‚Äù` in the HashTable, so that we can search it for the later numbers.
````js
function pair_with_targetsum(nums, target) {
  //Instead of using a two-pointer or a binary search approach, 
  //we can utilize a HashTable to search for the required pair. 
  //We can iterate through the array one number at a time. 
  //Let‚Äôs say during our iteration we are at number ‚ÄòX‚Äô, 
  //so we need to find ‚ÄòY‚Äô such that ‚ÄúX + Y == Target‚Äù. 
  
  //We will do two things here:
  const arr = {}
  for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++){
    let item = nums[i]
     
    if(target - item in arr) {
      //1. Search for ‚ÄòY‚Äô (which is equivalent to ‚ÄúTarget - X‚Äù) in the HashTable. 
      //If it is there, we have found the required pair
      return [arr[target - item], i]
    }
    arr[nums[i]] = i
    //2. Otherwise, insert ‚ÄúX‚Äù in the HashTable, so that we can search it for the later numbers.
  }
  return [-1, -1]
}

pair_with_targetsum([1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6)//[1, 3]
pair_with_targetsum([2, 5, 9, 11], 11)//[0, 2]
pair_with_targetsum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)//[0, 1]
pair_with_targetsum([3, 2, 4], 6)//[1, 2]
pair_with_targetsum([3, 3], 6)//[0, 1]
````

- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in the given array.
- The space complexity will also be `O(N)`, as, in the worst case, we will be pushing `N` numbers in the HashTable.
## Remove Duplicates (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

> Given an array of sorted numbers, <b>remove all duplicates</b> from it. You should <b>not use any extra space</b>; after removing the duplicates </i>in-place</i> return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

In this problem, we need to remove the duplicates </i>in-place</i> such that the resultant length of the array remains sorted. As the input array is sorted, therefore, one way to do this is to shift the elements left whenever we encounter duplicates. In other words, we will keep one pointer for iterating the array and one pointer for placing the next non-duplicate number. So our algorithm will be to iterate the array and whenever we see a non-duplicate number we move it next to the last non-duplicate number we‚Äôve seen.

* Assume the input is sorted
````js
function removeDuplicates(arr) {

  //shift the elements left when we encounter duplicates
  
  //one pointer for iterating
  let i = 1
  
  //one pointer for placing this next non-duplicate
  let nextNonDupe = 1

  while(i < arr.length) {
    if(arr[nextNonDupe -1] !== arr[i]) {
      arr[nextNonDupe] = arr[i]
      nextNonDupe++
    }
    i++
  }
  return nextNonDupe  
}

removeDuplicates([2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9])//4, The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].
removeDuplicates([2, 2, 2, 11])//2, The first two elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 11].

## Squaring a Sorted Array (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/

This is a straightforward question. The only trick is that we can have negative numbers in the input array, which will make it a bit difficult to generate the output array with squares in sorted order.

An easier approach could be to first find the index of the first non-negative number in the array. After that, we can use <b>Two Pointers</b> to iterate the array. One pointer will move forward to iterate the non-negative numbers, and the other pointer will move backward to iterate the negative numbers. At any step, whichever number gives us a bigger square will be added to the output array. 

Since the numbers at both ends can give us the largest square, an alternate approach could be to use <b>two pointers</b> starting at both ends of the input array. At any step, whichever pointer gives us the bigger square, we add it to the result array and move to the next/previous number according to the pointer. 

````js
function makeSquares(arr) {
  //The only trick is that we can have negative numbers in the input array, which will make it a bit difficult to generate the output array with squares in sorted order.

- The above algorithm‚Äôs time complexity will be `O(N)` as we are iterating the input array only once.
- The above algorithm‚Äôs space complexity will also be `O(N)`; this space will be used for the output array.

## üåü Triplet Sum to Zero (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

> Given an array of unsorted numbers, find all unique triplets in it that add up to zero.

This problem follows the <b>Two Pointers</b> pattern and shares similarities with [Pair with Target Sum](#üå¥-pair-with-target-sum-aka-"two-sum"-easy). A couple of differences are that the input array is not sorted and instead of a pair we need to find triplets with a target sum of zero.

To follow a similar approach, first, we will sort the array and then iterate through it taking one number at a time. Let‚Äôs say during our iteration we are at number `X`, so we need to find `Y` and `Z` such that `X + Y + Z == 0`. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is equal to `-X` (as from the above equation `Y + Z == -X`).

Another difference from [Pair with Target Sum](#üå¥-pair-with-target-sum-aka-"two-sum"-easy) is that we need to find all the unique triplets. To handle this, we have to skip any duplicate number. Since we will be sorting the array, so all the duplicate numbers will be next to each other and are easier to skip.

````js
function searchTriplets(arr) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => a-b)
  const triplets = [];
  
  for(i = 0; i< arr.length;i++) {
    
    if(i>0 && arr[i] === arr[i -1]){
      //skip the same element to avoid dupes

- Sorting the array will take `O(N * logN)`. The `searchPair()` function will take `O(N)`. As we are calling `searchPair()` for every number in the input array, this means that overall `searchTriplets()` will take `O(N * logN + N^2)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N^2)`.
- Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for sorting.

This problem follows the <b>Two Pointers pattern</b> and shares similarities with <b>Triplet Sum to Zero</b>. The only difference is that, in this problem, we need to find the triplets whose sum is less than the given target.

Let‚Äôs say the <b>two pointers</b> are called `low` and `high` which are pointing to the first and the last element of the array respectively. So while iterating, we will move all `0`s before `low` and all `2`s after `high` so that in the end, all `1`s will be between `low` and `high`.

````js
function dutchFlagSort(arr) {
  //all elements < low are 0, and all elements > high are 2
  //all elements >= low < i are 1
  let low = 0
  let high = arr.length - 1
  let i = 0
  
  while(i <= high) {
    if(arr[i] === 0) {
      //swap
      //[arr[i], arr[low]] = [arr[low], arr[i]]
      let temp = arr[i]
      arr[i] = arr[low]
      arr[low] = temp
      //increment i and low
      i++
      low++
    } else if(arr[i] === 1){
      i++
    } else{
      //the case for arr[i] === 2
      //swap
      // [arr[i], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[i]]
      temp = arr[i]
      arr[i] = arr[high]
      arr[high] = temp
      //decrement high only, after the swap the number
      //at index i could be 0, 1, or 2
      high--
    }
  }
  return arr
}

console.log(dutchFlagSort([1, 0, 2, 1, 0]))//[0 0 1 1 2]
console.log(dutchFlagSort([2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]))//[0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

## üåü Quadruple Sum to Target (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/

> Given an array of unsorted numbers and a `targetSum`, find all <b>unique quadruplets</b> in it, whose <b>sum is equal to the `targetSum`</b>.

This problem follows the <b>Two Pointers</b> pattern and shares similarities with <b>[Triplet Sum to Zero](#üåü-triplet-sum-to-zero-medium)</b>.

We can follow a similar approach to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time. At every step during the iteration, we will search for the quadruplets similar to <b>Triplet Sum to Zero</b> whose sum is equal to the given `target`.
````js
function searchQuads (arr, target) {
  //sort the array
  arr.sort((a,b) => a -b)
  
  let quads = []
   
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length-3; i++) {
    //skip the same element to avoid duplicate quadruplets
    if(i > 0 && arr[i] === arr[i-1]) {
      continue
    }
    for(let j = i +1; j < arr.length-2; j++) {
      //skip the same element to avoid duplicate quadruplets
      if(j > i + 1 && arr[j] === arr[j-1]){
        continue
      }
      searchPairs(arr, target, i, j, quads)
    }
  }
  return quads
}

function searchPairs(arr, targetSum, first, second, quads) {
  let start = second + 1
  let end = arr.length -1
  
  while(start < end) {
    const sum = arr[first] + arr[second] + arr[start] + arr[end]
    if(sum === targetSum) {
      //found the quadruplet
      quads.push([arr[first], arr[second], arr[start], arr[end]])
      start++

- Sorting the array will take `O(N*logN)`. Overall `searchQuads()` will take `O(N * logN + N¬≥)`, which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N¬≥)`.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` which is required for sorting.
## üåü Comparing Strings containing Backspaces (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/
>Given two strings containing backspaces (identified by the character `#`), check if the two strings are equal.

To compare the given strings, first, we need to apply the backspaces. An efficient way to do this would be from the end of both the strings. We can have separate pointers, pointing to the last element of the given strings. We can start comparing the characters pointed out by both the pointers to see if the strings are equal. If, at any stage, the character pointed out by any of the pointers is a backspace (`#`), we will skip and apply the backspace until we have a valid character available for comparison.

````js
function backspaceCompare(str1, str2) {
  //use two pointer approach to compare the strings
  let pointerOne = str1.length -1
  let pointerTwo = str2.length -1
  
  while(pointerOne >= 0 || pointerTwo >= 0){
    let i = getNextChar(str1, pointerOne)
    let j = getNextChar(str2, pointerTwo)
    
    if(i < 0 && j < 0){
      //reached the end of both strings
      return true
    } 
     if(i < 0 || j < 0){
      //reached the end of both strings
      return false
    } 
    if(str1[i] !== str2[j]){
      //check if the characters are equal
      return false
    }
    pointerOne = i - 1
    pointerTwo = j -1
  }
  return true
}


function getNextChar(str, index) {
  let backspaceCount = 0
  while(index >= 0) {
    if(str[index] === '#'){
      //found a backspace character
      backspaceCount++
    } else if(backspaceCount > 0) {
      //a non-backspace character
      backspaceCount--
    } else {
      break
    }
    //skip a backspace or valid character
    index--
  }
  return index
}

backspaceCompare("xy#z", "xzz#")//true, After applying backspaces the strings become "xz" and "xz" respectively.
backspaceCompare("xy#z", "xyz#")//false, After applying backspaces the strings become "xz" and "xy" respectively.
backspaceCompare("xp#", "xyz##")//true, After applying backspaces the strings become "x" and "x" respectively.  In "xyz##", the first '#' removes the character 'z' and the second '#' removes the character 'y'.
backspaceCompare("xywrrmp", "xywrrmu#p")//true, After applying backspaces the strings become "xywrrmp" and "xywrrmp" respectively.

- The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(M+N)` where `M` and `N` are the lengths of the two input strings respectively.
- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.

## üåü Minimum Window Sort (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/

> Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.

As we know, once an array is sorted (in ascending order), the smallest number is at the beginning and the largest number is at the end of the array. So if we start from the beginning of the array to find the first element which is out of sorting order i.e., which is smaller than its previous element, and similarly from the end of array to find the first element which is bigger than its previous element, will sorting the subarray between these two numbers result in the whole array being sorted?

Let‚Äôs try to understand this with the Example mentioned above. In the following array, what are the first numbers out of sorting order from the beginning and the end of the array:

````
[1, 3, 2, 0, -1, 7, 10]
````
Starting from the beginning of the array the first number out of the sorting order is `2` as it is smaller than its previous element which is `3`.
Starting from the end of the array the first number out of the sorting order is `0` as it is bigger than its previous element which is `-1`

As you can see, sorting the numbers between `3` and `-1` will not sort the whole array. To see this, the following will be our original array after the sorted subarray:
````
[1, -1, 0, 2, 3, 7, 10]
````
The problem here is that the smallest number of our subarray is `-1` which dictates that we need to include more numbers from the beginning of the array to make the whole array sorted. We will have a similar problem if the maximum of the subarray is bigger than some elements at the end of the array. To sort the whole array we need to include all such elements that are smaller than the biggest element of the subarray. So our final algorithm will look like:
1. From the beginning and end of the array, find the first elements that are out of the sorting order. The two elements will be our candidate subarray.
2. Find the maximum and minimum of this subarray.
3. Extend the subarray from beginning to include any number which is bigger than the minimum of the subarray.
4. Similarly, extend the subarray from the end to include any number which is smaller than the maximum of the subarray.

````js
function shortestWindowSort(arr) {
  let low = 0
  let high = arr.length - 1
  
  //find the first number out of sorting order from the beginning
  while(low < arr.length -1 && arr[low] <= arr[low+1]){
    low++
  }
  if(low === arr.length - 1) {
    // if the array is already sorted
    return 0
  }
  //find the first number out of sorting order from the end
  while(high > 0 && arr[high] >= arr[high - 1]){
    high--
  }
  
  //find the max and min of the subarray
  let subArrayMax = -Infinity
  let subArrayMin = Infinity
  
  for(let k = low; k < high + 1; k++) {
    subArrayMax = Math.max(subArrayMax, arr[k])
    subArrayMin = Math.min(subArrayMin, arr[k])
  }
  
  //extend the subarray to include any number which is bigger than the minumum of the subarray
  while(low > 0 && arr[low -1] > subArrayMin) {
    low--
  }
  //extend the subarray to include any number which is small than the maximum of the subarray
  while(high < arr.length - 1 && arr[high + 1] < subArrayMax){
    high++
  }
  
  return high - low + 1
}

shortestWindowSort([1,2,5,3,7,10,9,12])//5, We need to sort only the subarray [5, 3, 7, 10, 9] to make the whole array sorted
shortestWindowSort([1,3,2,0,-1,7,10])//5, We need to sort only the subarray [1, 3, 2, 0, -1] to make the whole array sorted
shortestWindowSort([1,2,3])//0, The array is already sorted
shortestWindowSort([3,2,1])// 3, The whole array needs to be sorted.
